This repo is built for nonlinear Schrödinger inversion problems. The package implements the forward simulation of nonlinear Schrödinger equations and enables flexible inversions of parameters as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. Key features of this package include:

- **Feature 1**: Simultaneous reconstruction of multiple parameters.


## Installation



The `startup.m` script is used to initialize the Inverse-Nonlinear-Schrodinger project in MATLAB by adding the necessary directories (`src`, `test`, and `examples`) to the MATLAB search path.

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository (Optional)**  
    If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/nsoedjak/Inverse-Nonlinear-Schrodinger.git
    ```

2. **Open MATLAB**  
    Launch MATLAB on your computer.

3. **Set the Current Directory**  
    In the MATLAB interface, navigate to the current directory toolbar and set it to the `Inverse-Nonlinear-Schrodinger` directory where the `startup.m` file is located. 

That's it! The `startup.m` script will automatically run, and the necessary paths will be added for this MATLAB session. Whenever you restart MATLAB, make sure that the `Inverse-Nonlinear-Schrodinger` directory is set as your current directory for the script to run automatically at startup.
